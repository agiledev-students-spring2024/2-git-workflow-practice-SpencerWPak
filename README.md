[AI Article Link](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/04/how-ai-is-quietly-changing-everyday-life-00138341)

AI has become a quickly evolving and impacting change in our world. It is becoming more intergrated with everyday life in things that you may not even suspect. From aspects of life from simple processing, to education, to even home buying, AI is being used to improve these experiences. Soon every aspect of our lives will be inadvertently effected by AI. With this we must ensure that the privacy of users and people must be protected along with ensuring the trainging data the AI is built off of is safe.

## Walid Al-Eisawi's Comments
I definitely think AI is already affecting our lives, directly or indirectly, and for better or for worse. Generally, I'd argue it is for better given how much more we can do, but the rapid rise of AI begs the question of regulation. Some might say it can grow too powerful if we don't do anything to prevent it, but I believe access to technology should not be restricted, despite its risks.
